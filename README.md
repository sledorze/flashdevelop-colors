flashdevelop-colors
===================

Color themes I create for FlashDevelop.

Solarized (http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) is my favorite coding theme, so you can expect to see variations based on it here.

solorized-dark-haxe.fdz - This is a Solarized Dark theme for Haxe in FlashDevelop. I have modeled it as closely to the version of the theme in Notepad++.
